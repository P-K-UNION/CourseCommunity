# LearningCommunity
**Welcome to PKU-P&KU (Peking University Pai-Kernel Union)!**

PKU-P&KU is a lifelong learning group dedicated to integrating STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) with business knowledge. Established on September 12, 2024, we encourage all members to actively participate in learning and discussions. We regularly hold sharing sessions and experience exchange activities. Additionally, we provide a wealth of electronic learning materials as part of our resources.

Please pay attention to the group's arrangements and keep all materials safe to avoid unauthorized sharing of resources or information.

All learning materials are for internal reference and exchange only and are strictly prohibited from any commercial use. All intellectual property rights to members' output and related works belong to the individual authors.

**Next Week's Preview**

As the association has just been established, we currently have two groups: the Mathematics Group (Dong Jiale, Xia Xinyu) and the Information+ Group (Chen Yan, Chen Zongzhe, Lin Jinzhan). The specific arrangements are as follows:

- The Mathematics Group will provide an introduction to Mathematical Analysis, Advanced Algebra, and Advanced Probability Statistics, and explore their integration with business knowledge.
- The Information+ Group will share content on machine learning models, factor investing, and Kaggle competition learning.

We will publish the content of this group meeting and more materials on GitHub (URL: https://github.com/P-K-UNION/LearningCommunity) and Peking Universityâ€™s cloud storage. Everyone is welcome to participate actively!
